During this project, I created a mini social network displaying posts from different users.

The most important thing about this work is that it was written without JavaScript. To develop this small project, I used **Java, Spring Boot, Thymeleaf, HTMX and NO Javascript**.

Of course, at this stage the project needs backend and frontend refinement.
